Shor's documentation!
================================
Shor is a simple, modular, and extensible quantum computing API written in python.

**Our mission:** Make quantum computing easy and accessible to everyone

* `Shor on Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/shor>`_

Use shor if you need a library that:
------------------------------------

* Enables fast prototyping of quantum circuits
* Simulates small quantum programs
* Makes quantum computing easy

Currently, shor supports running circuits on Qiskit providers like IBMQ quantum computers.
In the near future, we plan to support other providers so you can write your program once and run it anywhere.

We are in early development and looking for contributors!
